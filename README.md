# Propono
Propono is a simple image gallery application that stores input image URLs in a local Docker (SQL) database and displays them for you on a nice page. Created in only one day for SALT @2022 for the salt hackaton.

Propono is made using .NET Web API (C#) together with Entity Framework Core and Docker on the back end, and React (TypeScript) with some help from Axios on the front end.
The application will most likely contain some small errors and pieces of code that could be improved quite easily, but in the spirit of this being a "one day project", I will not be refactoring the code.
I spent much time on the front end design of this project to make it look and behave nicely, while being easy to use and understand. Mobile first, of course!
